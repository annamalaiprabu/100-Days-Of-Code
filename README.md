# 100-Days-Of-Code
#### This is my 100-Days-Of-Code. 
<br>
I've been wanted to take up this challenge publicly for a real long time and, now the time has come!
<br>
<br>
I personally believe we are all creatures of habit. It is these habits that fundamentally define who we are and what we do. I too want to cultivate the habit of coding and that's why I am taking up this challenge.
<br>
<br>
You can have a look at the rules I will be adhering to <a href="https://github.com/annamalaiprabu/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/rules.md">here</a> throughout the challenge and my daily logs <a href="https://github.com/annamalaiprabu/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/dailylog.md">here</a> to catch up and follow me on my journey.
<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I would like to thank you for being a part of my journey ❤️.
