# My Daily Log
## Day 0 / 26-02-2023
- Today, was the day I got familiar with how Git and GitHub work together seamlessly and of all the wonderful features they possess.
- I also got things set up for my 100-Days-Of-Code Challenge on GitHub
- I am really eager for what awaits for me tomorrow üòÑ

## Day 1 / 27-02-2023
- Today, I logged in <strong>1.5 hours</strong> 
- I started learning DSA and begun with solving basic maths problems starting from the concept of digits and solving few problems on that to beginning with how to reverse the digits of a number 
- One feedback I have for myself is to turn on the timer on the practice platforms to strengthen my ability to perform under stress and solve problems faster
- I must revise again on Day 2 , Day 3 , Day 8 , Day 22 , Day 64 
- You can see my today's progress <a href="https://github.com/annamalaiprabu/DSA/blob/master/Learn%20the%20Basics/Know%20Basic%20Maths/basicmath.cpp">here</a>
- and, thanks for being a part of my journey ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Day 2 / 28-02-2023
- Today, I logged in <strong>2.5 hours</strong>
- I learned to print a reversed number where the trailing zeroes where automatically rejected, checked whether a number was a palindrome or not, checked for an Armstrong number and printed all the divisors of a number.
- Along with that today was my first time I solved a LeetCode Problem üòä
- I must revise again on Day 3 , Day 4 , Day 9 , Day 23 , Day 65 
- You can see my today's progress <a href="https://github.com/annamalaiprabu/DSA/commit/e28848768c7419cdc7600281c8fc99bb1200c204">here</a>

## Day 3 / 01-03-2023
- Today, I logged in <strong>1.5 hours</strong>
